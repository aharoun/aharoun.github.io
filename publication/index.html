    We build a model of firm-level innovation, productivity growth and reallocation featuring endogenous entry and exit. A new and central economic force is the selection between high- and low-type firms, which differ in terms of their innovative capacity. We estimate the parameters of the model using US Census micro data on firm-level output, R&amp;D and patenting. The model provides a good fit to the dynamics of firm entry and exit, output and R&amp;D. Taxing the continued operation of incumbents can lead to sizable gains (of the order of 1.4% improvement in welfare) by encouraging exit of less productive firms and freeing up skilled labor to be used for R&amp;D by high-type incumbents. Subsidies to the R&amp;D of incumbents do not achieve this objective because they encourage the survival and expansion of low-type firms.

  Lack of Selection and Limits to Delegation: Firm Dynamics in Developing Countries

    Managerial delegation is essential for firm growth. While firms in poor countries often shun outside managers and instead recruit among family members, the pattern is quite the opposite for firms in rich countries. In this paper, we ask whether these differences in managerial delegation have important aggregate effects. We construct a model of firm growth where entrepreneurs have fixed-time endowments to run their daily operations. As firms grow larger, the need to delegate decision-making authority increases. Firms in poor countries might therefore decide to remain small if delegating managerial tasks is difficult. We calibrate the model to firm-level data from the U.S. and India. We show that the model is quantitatively consistent with the experimental micro evidence on managerial efficiency and firm growth reported in Bloom et al. (2013). Our quantitative analysis shows that the low efficiency of delegation in India can account for 5% of productivity and 15% of income differences between the U.S. and India in steady state. We also show that such inefficient delegation possibilities reduce the size of Indian firms, but would cause substantially more harm for U.S. firms. This is because there are important complementarities between the ease of delegation and other factors affecting firm growth.

  Technology Adoption and the Latin American TFP Gap

    We develop a novel methodology to study the dynamics of technology adoption across countries. We identify changes in “technology” as changes in the productivity of the frontier country that have a lagged effect on the productivity of the adopting country. A simple calibration illustrates how the results of the analysis can be used to estimate the differentials in TFP and TFP growth that are attributable to technology. We illustrate our methodology by studying the adoption process between Latin America and the Carribean (LAC) countries and the US. Our analysis suggests an 8 year adoption lag, after which technologies are fully or nearly-fully adopted; this estimate suggests that technology can account for a productivity gap of 4-10% (provided that there is full adoption in the long-run), and a TFP growth differential between 0-0.5%. We illustrate that our estimates are consistent both with the timing of the IT revolution, and with cross-country patent citation data. Finally, we provide a simple theory about the potential determinants of the measured adoption lags which highlights a possible link between the static wedges and technology adoption decisions.

  Shock Therapy! What Role for Thai Monetary Policy?

    Thailand had to endure three major shocks during 2008–2011: the global financial crisis, the Japanese earthquake, and the Thai floods of 2011. Over this period, consistent with its inflation targeting framework, the Bank of Thailand (BOT) let the exchange rate depreciate and cut interest rates (to, for example, a historically low level of 1¼ percent by mid-2009). This paper seeks to uncover the role of monetary policy in softening the impact of these shocks. Specifically, it seeks to address the following question: if an inflation targeting framework underpinned by a flexible exchange rate regime had not been in place, how would the economic contractions associated with these shocks have differed? Counterfactual simulations based on an estimated structural model indicate that countercyclical monetary policy and exchange rate flexibility added up to a total of 4 percentage points to real GDP growth during periods when Thailand had to weather these three major shocks.

  Monetary Policy and Output Gap : Mind the Composition

    We estimate an output gap measure for Turkey in a Bayesian framework with special reference to its components. Our results suggest that Turkey experienced a notable divergence between domestic and external demand with no sign of overheating for the whole economy in the post-Lehman crisis period. This finding confirms the basis for the new policy framework of the Central Bank of Turkey (CBT), which was characterized by rapid credit expansion and growing current account deficit without significant inflationary pressures. Under these circumstances, conventional monetary policy practice focusing solely on aggregate output gap may suggest policy prescriptions inconsistent with financial stability. In this regard, extracting the components of output gap would help policymakers make a suitable policy design to avoid any contradiction among objectives.

    This study documents the stylized facts about the business cycles in Turkey using quarterly data between 1987 and 2009. In particular, we document the business cycle turning points and average duration of cycles for Turkey, as well as the optimal smoothing parameter for Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter estimated in line with our estimate of average business cycle duration for 1987-2009 period, 20 quarters, which is shorter compared to developed countries, and comparable to other developing countries. For filtering procedure, we use this estimated parameter, in addition to 1600, in HP filter and compare our findings. We find that business cycle relationships between macroeconomic variables in Turkey are mostly in accordance with the patterns observed for developing countries, which significantly differ from developed countries’ business cycle facts. In particular, the real side of the economy is characterized by high volatility of consumption and a countercyclical pattern for net exports. Other important findings are that financial variables such as credit or sovereign spreads are very volatile and strongly correlated with output. In addition, the results show that the properties of the relationship between economic activity, prices and the interest rates differs between pre-2001 and post-2001 period, whereas the relationship among the real variables shows a smaller change between these periods.

  Did Korean Monetary Policy Help Soften the Impact of the Global Financial Crisis of 2008-2009?

    Korea was one of the Asian economies hardest hit by the global financial crisis. Anticipating the downturn that would follow the episode of extreme financial stress, the Bank of Korea (BOK) let the exchange rate depreciate as capital flowed out, and preemptively cut the policy rate by 325 basis points. But did it work? This paper seeks a quantitative answer to the following question: Were it not for an inflation targeting framework underpinned by a flexible exchange rate regime, how much deeper would the recession have been? Taking the most intense year of the crisis as our baseline (2008:Q4-2009:Q3), counterfactual simulations indicate that rather the actual outcome of a -2.1 percent contraction, the outturn would have been -2.9 percent if the BOK had not implemented countercyclical and discretionary interest rate cuts. Furthermore, had a fixed exchange rate regime been in place, simulations indicate that output would have contracted by -7.5 percent over the same four-quarter period. In other words, exchange rate flexibility and the interest rate cuts implemented by the BOK helped substantially soften the impact of the global financial crisis on the Korean economy. These counterfactual experiments are based on an estimated structural model, which, along with standard nominal and real rigidities, includes a financial accelerator mechanism in an open-economy framework.

    Turkey is an interesting case study because it was one of the hardest hit emerging economies by the global financial crisis, with a year-over-year contraction of 15 percent during the first quarter of 2009. At the same time, anticipating the fallout from the crisis, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) decreased policy rates by an astounding 1025 basis points over the November 2008 to November 2009 period. In this context, this paper addresses the following broad question: If an inflation targeting framework underpinned by a flexible exchange rate regime was not adopted, how much deeper would the recent recession have been? Counterfactual experiments based on an estimated structural model provide quantitative evidence which suggests that the recession would have been substantially more severe. In other words, the interest rate cuts implemented by the CBRT and exchange rate flexibility both helped substantially soften the impact of the global financial crisis.

Two alternative methods, proposed by Pedersen (2001) and Dermoune et al (2008) are used for estimation which gives the values for the HP Filter smoothing parameter for Turkey as 98 and 19, respectively. Using these estimates, we find that (1) estimated trend component of Turkish GDP is very volatile, which is in line with the conjectures of Aguiar and Gopinath (2007) for emerging market countries (2) absolute volatilities for the cyclical variations in GDP and its components are smaller compared to 1600 (3) our estimates give similar results with the frequently used smoothing parameter value in terms of relative volatility of components of GDP with respect to volatility of GDP.

    This paper compares the ability of different market instruments in terms of predicting monetary policy decisions to  nd out which one best captures market participants’ policy expectations. Towards this end, policy rate expectations implied by various market instruments and different approaches are derived for the period between July 2006 and October 2009. Empirical results show that market based monetary policy expectations in Turkey can most successfully be obtained by using the one week Turkish Lira Interbank Bid Rate (TRLIBID).

    In this paper, the effects of Central Bank of Turkey&rsquo;s interest rate decisions on relatively longer-term interest rates in financial markets and risk premia as well as on returns of the ISE-100, ISE-Financial indexes and exchange rates are studied by separating the anticipated component of monetary policy from that unexpected by financial markets. The results show that policy rate changes have significant effects on financial markets, especially on bond yields. Equity returns are not significantly driven by monetary policy surprises, whereas the responses of exchange rates are small. Thus, it appears that the transmission of monetary policy in Turkey is mainly through its effects on longer-term interest rates.
